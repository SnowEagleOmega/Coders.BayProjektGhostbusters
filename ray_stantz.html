          -Ray Stantz; Ghostbusters</p>
      </div>

			<p>Dr.Raymond "Ray" Stantz was one of the original Ghostbusters<br>
				and was one of the most devoted to the pursuit of studying the<br>
				paranormal. He appears in all major forms of Ghostbusters <br>
				Franchise, however like Peter and Winston was a guest on<br>
				Extreme Ghostbusters.</p>

			<h2>Personality</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>Ray's devotion to the company was obvious when he mortgaged the
				house his parents had left to him to provide the capital to begin
				Ghostbusters Inc. Ray was also a handy man and largely responsible
				for the repair and modification of the Ecto-1. He wasn't particularly
				religious, but did seem to believe in a spiritual realm of sorts.
				In the video game it is shown he believes in the concept of a soul.
				He also states that he played a game entitled Ghosts and Gargoyles
				while in the seminary, indicating he may have at one time considered
				becoming a clergyman.</p>

			<p>Ray is regarded by Peter as the "heart of the Ghostbusters." Indeed,
				 Ray displays a level of ebullience when it comes to Ghostbusting
				 and paranormal science in general unmatched by any of his colleagues
				 (One example is were Peter was slimed by Slimer is where he exclaims
				 "That's great! ACTUAL physical contact!"). His mention of an undersea,
				 unexplained mass sponge migration shows he's more than eager to go
				 anywhere it takes to study the strange and unusual.</p>

			<p>Ray is generally the most positive of the group in outlook, however
				 bits of cynicism will surface on occasion.("Yuppie Larvae")</p>

			<h2>History</h2>
			<hr>

			<p>Ghostbusters</p>
			<p>Before they were kicked out of the University, Ray was devoting a lot
				of his workday to interviewing people who had some sort of encounter
				with the paranormal. After the entanglement with the library ghost, Ray
				was more motivated to continue on with that type of work. When the guys
				were let go by Dean Yager, he was initially crushed, primarily concerned
				with his academic integrity, financial stability, etc. Ray had briefly
				worked in the private sector beforehand, and knew it wasn't conductive
				to his line of work, as they expected notable results.</p>

			<p>After talking with Peter Venkman and Egon Spengler, they all decided to
				try hunting ghosts full time. Ray even mortgaged the house he was born
				in provide the starting capital to get the company started and buy the
				firehouse. In addition, he rummaged through used car lots to find a
				suitable vehicle and repair it to make the Ecto-1.</p>

			<p>Dr. Stantz also has the distinction of being the first Ghostbuster to
				meet	Slimer. Unlike his other continuity, however Ray dropped his
				cigarette in fear. He then went proton blasting, after his call for
				assistance was unheard by Venkman.</p>

			<p>Ray accidentally chose the form of Gozer's appearance because of his
				childhood times at Camp Waconda. Despite his initial attempt at
				negotiations, he wound up	fighting Gozer with his Proton Pack. After
				reversing the particle flow to force Gozer back into his realm, Ray was
				concerned about the other guys' welfare after the explosion, and then
				celebrated with them all afterward. Although this was short-lived by
				the, "ungrateful, yuppie larvae!" representing the city, county	and
				state of New York.</p>


			<p>Ghostbuster ll</p>
			<p>In the second film he and Winston were entertainers for parties. When
				he was not doing that, he was running his bookstore, Ray's Occult Books.
				However, when Dana Barrett comes to Egon and later Ray, it becomes clear
				that something supernatural was happening underneath New York.</p>

			<p>Ray and Egon experiment with the Psychomagnotheric Slime they find and
				eventually discover a way to not only positively charge the slime, but
				utilize it to animate the Statue of Liberty in their final assault on
				Vigo the Carpathian. Ray also briefly becomes the host for Vigo himself,
				but a liberal dousing of the positively charged mood slime quickly cures
				him of that.</p>

			<p>Ghostbusters: The Video Game</p>
			<p>In Ghostbusters: The Video Game, Ray is one of the senior 'busters. He
				is voiced by none other than Dan Aykroyd and thus is similar to his
				movie counterpart. He is still the wide-eyed enthusiast and still more
				than eager to expand his knowledge in regards to researching the
				paranormal. More than once he asks the Rookie to collect samples and
				take readings for later research. Ray is also the most vocally
				supportive of the Rookie.</p>

			<p>It is mentioned that the mortgage for the Firehouse is in his name. His
				selection for the Stay Puft form of Gozer's "Destructor Form"
				was mentioned in a quote "It wasn't me this time, I swear it!" when the
				'busters see that Stay Puft is, once again, terrorizing New York. Ray is
				the most visibly shaken to see Mr. Stay Puft again.</p>

			<p>Ray is shown to possess skill in operating nautical vessels (i.e.:
				migrant sponge observation, mentioned earlier) as he's the primary
				navigator on Marine Ecto-8.</p>
