          -Louis Tully; Ghostbusters</p>
      </div>

      <p>Louis Tully is an accountant who lived down the hall from Dana Barrett, in an apartment building on Central Park West. Five years later, he became the Ghostbusters' accountant.</p>

      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Louis is the quintessential nerd. While a very good-natured guy, he
				sports a level of social awkwardness that eclipses even Egon's. He tries
				to be hip and cool, but never pulls it off (he would work out to exercise
				videos, but at double speed). He tends to be obsessive compulsive when it
				comes to matters of taxes. More often than not, conversation with him
				will eventually steer into tax or monetary matters. He's always willing
				to help out, sometimes with embarrassing results for him, and he'll
				always point out an opportunity to a friend where they can save money on
				something. He's also shown to be pretty good with children, a manner he
				admitted learning from owning a pet hamster.</p>

      <p>Deep down, Louis really wants to break out of his humdrum little
				existence and be a hero. Even though his assault on the slime shell
				coating the museum was at best negligible, Louis still put his heart into
				helping out.</p>

			<p>Despite his social handicaps, Louis is apparently a top-notch CPA and
				tax attorney. Peter even held his skills in high enough esteem that he
				kept Louis on as the team's personal finance specialist.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <hr>

      <p>Ghostbusters</p>
      <p>In 1984, Louis Tully was a resident of the Shandor Building at 55
				Central Park West and lived on the 22nd floor. Louis occupied 2202. He
				had unreciprocated romantic feelings for Dana Barrett and clumsily
				bursted out of his apartment whenever she was in the hallway. He was
				mysteriously locked out of his apartment numerous times, unaware of the
				supernatural history of the building. </p>

      <p>One night, Louis was hosting a party in honor of his fourth anniversary
				as an accountant. At the time the Terror Dogs, Vinz Clortho (The
				Keymaster) and Zuul (The Gatekeeper) had escaped from their statues and
				began to search for host bodies. Vinz found its way into Louis' bedroom.
				After Louis unknowingly tossed the coats of Ted and Annette Fleming onto
				Vinz, it disrupted the party, smashing through the closet door
				terrifiying the guests and chased Louis until it cornered him in Central
				Park outside the Tavern on the Green. Louis fainted when Vinz roared at
				him after which the Terror Dog possessed him.</p>

			<p>Louis, now inhabited by Vinz Clortho, ran around Central Park harassing
				random people in search of Zuul, The Gatekeeper. He bumped into a
				Coachman who gave him a hard time for talking to his horse. The possessed
				Louis growled at him as his eyes flared purplish-red. He ran off rambling
				incoherently about the coming of Gozer. He later was picked up by the
				Cops, who in turn dropped him off at the Firehouse. Egon Spengler took
				some P.K.E. readings and took custody of him. Egon scanned Louis'
				brainwaves and saw an image of the demonic Terror Dog's head on a screen
				hooked up to the device. Louis introduced himself as Vinz Clortho and
				explained his purpose to Egon Spengler and Janine Melnitz. Following Mr.
				Peck's visit and the resulting explosion, Louis escaped, staggering
				around amidst the chaos in New York City in search of Zuul, who had
				possessed Dana Barrett, until finally finding The Gatekeeper in Dana's
				demolished apartment. They introduced each other as Keymaster and
				Gatekeeper and proceeded to meet at the center of Dana's ravaged
				apartment in a passionate embrace, kissing lustfully before heading up to
				the rooftop. Louis and Dana later consummated their demonic union atop a
				large stone table in front of the Temple of Gozer, later transforming
				back into their natural Terror Dog forms. After the Ghostbusters battled
				Gozer, Louis was released from his possession as the Keymaster and
				returned to normal. Egon, Ray Stantz and Winston Zeddemore helped Louis
				get out of the charred remains of Vinz.</p>


      <p>Ghostbuster ll</p>
      <p>At some point between 1984 and 1989, Louis earned a law degree at night
				school and expanded his specialties as a tax attorney. On occasion, he
				worked on probate. In late 1989, at Peter's insistence, Louis reluctantly
				became the defense counsel for the Ghostbusters. Despite only
				specializing as a lawyer for cases of taxation, he won the case. Louis'
				victory was indirect, as the Scoleri Brothers appeared in the courtroom,
				causing everyone to run for their lives and they captured Louis' rival
				attorney. After the Scoleri Brothers flew outside with the Prosecutor,
				Judge Wexler wailed. The Ghostbusters informed him he was next. He begged
				them to do something and help him but Ray deferred him to Louis. Louis
				pointed out the Ghostbusters were still under a restraining order
				preventing them from using their equipment. Wexler caved and rescinded
				all charges against them and dropped the case. Louis cheered over winning
				the case. Louis was in awe of the Trap upon the Scoleri Brothers' capture.
				He walked out with the Ghostbusters and held up the Trap. After the
				Ghostbusters went back in business, Louis was part of their staff as
				personal accountant and tax attorney, even going so far as to appear in
				one of the TV ads. At one point when working in the Ghostbusters'
				Firehouse, Louis remarked he smelled something pungent, then caught
				Slimer eating his lunch. This caused both Slimer and Louis to flee in
				opposite directions.</p>

      <p>During the week of New Years Eve, Louis finally struck up the courage to
				ask Janine out on a date. Janine was busy with babysitting Oscar but
				asked him to come along. While babysitting with Janine at Peter's
				apartment, the two became closer and made out on the couch. Oscar was
				kidnapped. After Dana left to go to the museum, Louis learned the
				Ghostbusters had been wrongly committed to Parkview Psychiatric Hospital.
				He went there and, after they were released, briefed them on the surge in
				paranormal activity as they quickly suited up and walked out. He returned
				to the Firehouse and with Janine's help, suited up in one of Egon's
				Uniforms and then left by foot with a Proton Pack on. Underestimating the
				weight of the equipment, Louis quickly became tired. He was saved by the
				timely arrival of a city bus that Slimer had commandeered, patching up
				their incident earlier. Shortly upon his arrival at the museum, Louis
				starts blasting the Slime Shell covering it as Vigo became weakened from
				revelers' singing. Upon the defeat of Vigo, the slime shield dissipated,
				and the crowd hailed Louis as a hero even though he had little to do with
				the situation. He proudly proclaimed he was "a Ghostbuster."</p>

      <p>Ghostbusters: The Video Game</p>
      <p>Louis held onto Egon's coveralls as a memento of his experience during
				the Vigo incident, and hung up behind his desk in the lobby. He
				apparently switched the label from Spengler to Tully. In anticipation of
				the Ghostbusters offering franchising, Louis was tasked to scout
				locations around the USA, including Chicago, Los Angeles, and Cincinnati.
				During the start of the Thanksgiving 1991 holiday weekend, during the
				time when The Rookie was hired, Louis was not at work. He had not been
				feeling well and left work early, leaving a note on his desk informing
				the others. If the work piling up on his desk is any indication, Louis
				was sick for several days, at least.</p>
