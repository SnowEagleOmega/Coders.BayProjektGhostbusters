      </div>

      <p>Dr. Egon Spengler, Ph.D. is a former professor of paranormal<br>
         studies at the Columbia University. Upon his termination,<br>
         Egon founded Ghostbusters, Inc. along with Doctors Ray <br>
         Stantz and Peter Venkman. He is considered the brain behind<br>
         the Ghostbusters and has designed and built nearly all of their<br>
         equipment, including the Proton Pack and the Storage facility.<br>
         Typically, Ray is the only other member of the Ghostbusters <br>
         who has no trouble understanding Egon's technical jargon.</p>

      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Egon is hard-working and constantly focused on the paranormal activity
        of New York. His life revolves around scientific study, in general as
        well as on ghosts. In his spare time, he collects spores, molds, and
        fungus. He doesn't articulate his emotions well and has described himself
        as "always serious." His childhood may have not been a very happy one, as
        is suggested his parents were emotionally neglectful; Egon once shared
        with Ray that they "did not believe in toys"; he described Oscar's
        playroom as "very cheerful" in a tone that suggested he was aware he
        missed out on something nice. His parents gave him part of a Slinky once,
        and he straightened it. Once, during the Vigo incident, Egon flatly
        informed Mayor Lenny's porter that the Proton Pack was not a toy. Despite
        Janine Melnitz' hints that she was attracted to him, he seemed to ignore
        her romantic advances, kept quiet, and their relationship remained
        platonic. However, even though Egon admitted when he was terrified at the
        sight of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, he stayed with the others, showing
        bravery and a cool head even in the face of doom. It was his idea to
        cross the streams, which ultimately saved the world. Egon also has a
        dead-pan sense of humor and has been known to be sly, such as after the
        Ghostbusters' first case, he discretely holds up his fingers to show
        Peter the amount the Sedgewick Hotel will be billed.</p>

      <p>Egon has a very dry sense of humor, once jokingly stating that most
        women would be "more interested in his epididymis," rather than his
        intellect. He is not immune to anger, as under duress he has been shown
        to swear twice during the Gozer incident. He even lunged at Walter Peck
        in anger when Peck ordered them arrested for the disruption regarding the
        shutdown of the containment grid, despite the fact Peck himself was
        entirely responsible, and ignored Egon's repeated explanation of why it
        would be so dangerous to do so. After the Ghostbusters narrowly escaped
        from Shandor Island, Ray began enthusiastically asking how it was and if
        they seen anything cool, Egon simply told him to "Shut up."</p>

      <p>Egon does, on occasion, smirk and give a wisecrack; such as during their
        encounter with the Opera Diva ghost during the Shandor incident Egon says
        "The fat lady's singing!" And while exploring Central Park's Cult
        Cemetery, Peter says "This isn't the Central Park I'm used to." to which
        Egon replies, "You still have your wallet?" Generally though, Egon
        remains largely pragmatic with a straight-to-the-point demeanor.</p>

      <p>Egon puts few restraints on the scope of his paranormal research. This
        is evident shortly after Dana Barrett's First Avenue incident, as he
        conducts experiments in his lab in which he deliberately incites couples
        to argue. When Egon and Ray discover the Psychomagnotheric Slime, aka
        "mood slime", he and Ray perform various tests themselves, including
        shouting verbal abuse at it, singing to it, saying sweet, nurturing
        things to it, and Egon even sleeps with it to learn its' response. His
        efforts, and arguably sacrificing a personal life, pay off, as it his
        theories and decisions from clear-thinking, that ultimately save his
        friends multiple times.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <hr>

      <p>Ghostbusters</p>
      <p>Egon was very interested in paranormal phenomenon, even while working
        with Ray Stantz and Peter Venkman at the University. He and Ray Stantz
        studied paranormal literature in their spare time and were interested in
        theories of reincarnation.</p>

      <p>Egon was usually the first to interview case subjects, adding to their
        mantra, "we're ready to believe you." Examples were Dana Barrett from her
        Zuul encounter and her carriage phenomenon with Oscar. Even people Peter
        called "schizo" always went to either Egon or Ray to describe their
        paranormal experiences, no matter how far-fetched their stories were. For
        his part, Venkman once took back everything negative he said about him,
        rewarding the fellow scientist with his favourite candy bar (a Crunch bar).
        Egon's only weakness is evidently sugar (or at least snacks), as he is
        seen, on occasion, snacking.</p>

      <p>Egon developed the technology behind the P.K.E. Meter, the Proton Pack,
        the Trap, and the storage facility. He was also aware of the risk of
        crossing the streams. He spent a lot of time focusing on the stability of
        the storage facility, and was concerned about the possibilities of a
        P.K.E. surge of dangerous proportions. Egon was particularly critical of
        Walter Peck's actions, and his attitude that the Ghostbusters were
        responsible for the explosion of the containment unit that occurred when
        Peck ordered a municipal worker to shut the unit down. After their
        encounter with Stay Puft, Egon suggested an atypical solution when he
        recommended blasting Gozer's dimensional portal while crossing the proton
        streams to reverse the particle flow and send Gozer back to his/its'
        dimension.</p>

      <p>Egon once tried to drill a hole in his own head, (A process known as
        trepanation.) which "would have worked" if Venkman hadn't stopped him.</p>


      <p>Ghostbuster ll</p>
      <p>Due to the large amount of collateral damage the city of New York
        suffered from the battle with Gozer, the Ghostbusters were sued by nearly
        every county and city agency in New York. Additionally a judicial
        restraining order was enacted which barred the Ghostbusters from
        performing services as paranormal investigators and eliminators,
        effectively putting them out of business. Five years after the events of
        the first film Egon was working at the Institute for Advanced Theoretical
        Research and was conducting experiments on human emotions. A negative
        test involved keeping a couple with marriage problems locked in a room
        for hours and gradually raising the temperature. A positive test involved
        a girl in a room with dozens of stuffed animals and a puppy. He was the
        first person Dana Barrett contacted when her baby carriage took off by
        itself. Egon recommended bringing in Ray, and they both performed a
        physical exam on Dana's son Oscar. Egon, along with Peter and Ray were
        later arrested after digging a large hole under 1st avenue as part of
        their paranormal investigations to help Dana. During the course of their
        trial they were found guilty of willful destruction of public property,
        fraud, violating their judicial restraining order, and malicious mischief
        by judge Stephen Wexler (whom Egon said was known as "The Hammer").</p>

      <p>While angrily insulting the trio judge Wexler inadvertently released
        the ghosts of the Scoleri Brothers; two murderers he sentenced to death
        by the electric chair. During the chaos judge Wexler dismisses the
        charges against the Ghostbusters, and rescinds the judicial restraining
        order allowing Egon, Ray, and Peter to capture the ghosts, effectively
        putting the Ghostbusters back in business. Egon had a dry sense of humor,
        of which he used on Peter to bewilder him, and smirked at his friend's
        cluelessness on what the word "epididymis" was. Egon primarily worked
        with Ray, both of whom were still living at the Firehouse, conducting
        research on the pink slime. Still very scientifically minded, Egon seems
        to have loosened up a little bit, letting his sense of humor show and
        even giving Dana a smile and Peter (who was carried away with
        photographing Vigo's portrait), a knowing smile.</p>

      <p>Ghostbusters: The Video Game</p>
      <p>Egon becomes significantly more 'hands-on' during the course of the
        video game. He and Ray instruct the Rookie in the use of the Proton Pack
        and its eventual PCS (Paranormal Countermeasure System) upgrades. Over
        the course of the game, it becomes evident that he was somewhat
        traumatized by their exhausting trek up the stairs of 55 Central Park
        West. While in the alternate dimension of the library, Egon is heard to
        groan, "Oh no," and when Ray asks if he saw something scary, Egon replies,
        "Stairs, lots of stairs.."</p>

      <p>Egon still collects spores, molds, and fungus. When the Ghostbusters
        return to the Sedgewick Hotel, Ray reveals Egon was once a licensed
        coroner in the past. He still has a minor interest in it as a hobby.</p>
