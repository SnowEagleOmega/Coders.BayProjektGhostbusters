          -Janine Melnitz; Ghostbusters</p>
      </div>

      <p>Janine Melnitz was the receptionist that worked for the boys<br>
				 in grey at the Firehouse. She, like the four Ghostbusters and<br>
				 Slimer, is usually present in all Ghostbusters media.</p>

      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Janine is highly sardonic with her eccentric bosses, while taking her
				job in such an unusual business in stride. As such, no matter how strange
				circumstances become at work, she is largely unflappable. Her hobbies
				included racquetball and reading.</p>

      <p>In the first film, Janine showed romantic interest in Egon, but by the
				second film, begins a relationship with Louis Tully.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <hr>

      <p>Ghostbusters</p>
      <p>Janine was the first person hired to work at the Firehouse. She staffed
				the phones and kept track of appointments, calls, messages, etc. She
				showed a romantic interest in Egon Spengler, but he didn't return her
				advances. While initially extremely bored with her job and seemingly
				indifferent to the business, the moment she received an urgent plea for
				assistance from the haunted Sedgewick Hotel, she roared out a joyful "We
				got one!" and enthusiastically activated the muster signal for the
				primary staff.</p>

      <p>Once the boys picked up more and more clients, she began to complain of
				being overworked. After Dr. Venkman implied that perhaps she'd find more
				pleasure in another low-wage job, she took offense, but stopped her
				complaints. When Walter Peck showed up to shut down the storage facility,
				she tried to stop them, but the Police Captain, along with all of Walter's
				paperwork, gave her no choice. Before the explosion at the firehouse, she
				kept watch with Egon Spengler over Louis Tully.</p>

			<p>After the guys blow up the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, sending Gozer back
				to its own dimension, Janine is seen at the entrance of the building,
				hugging Egon, as he heads to the Ecto-1.</p>


      <p>Ghostbuster ll</p>
      <p>In late 1989, Janine was re-hired following the Ghostbusters' capture of
				the Scoleri Brothers during their trial. She soon responded to a new
				phone call. After hearing what the customer says, she smiled and replied,
				"Yes, we're back." In the weeks after, the Ghostbusters were flush with
				business. In one instance, she was entrusted with two Traps by the guys
				and walked off to deposit the ghosts in the Containment Unit. She becomes
				attracted to Louis Tully, the staff accountant.</p>

      <p>Venkman hired her to babysit Dana Barrett's son Oscar while he went on
				a date with Dana. When Louis asked her out, Janine had to decline but
				invited him to instead come with her to babysit. They ended up making out
				in Peter's apartment. Later, when the Ghostbusters are stuck at the
				Manhattan Museum of Art, she lends Louis one of Egon's uniforms.</p>

      <p>Ghostbusters: The Video Game</p>
      <p>Janine retains her job of monitoring the phones at the Firehouse,
				arranging appointments, and the other secretarial work involved in
				keeping the Ghostbusters business operating. She is seen in the scene
				before the Rookie is introduced, she is holding calls, and gets a rather
				odd one when a customer wants to know if they can contact a dead relative
				to get the combination for a safe. If the Rookie sticks around for a
				while between investigations, he can overhear some of Janine's phone
				calls, including some complaints of having used up all of her float
				holidays, copier problems, a mix up involving ordering dragon blood, and
				general remarks on the franchising of the Ghostbusters establishment.</p>

      <p>On Thanksgiving morning, Janine's favorite pair of pumps broke and
				Lester's was out of her favorite flavor of tea, chamomile. While the
				Ghostbusters were returning from Shandor Island, Janine was rendered
				unconscious. When she came to, Ilyssa Selwyn was missing, the Containment
				Unit was shut off again, and the Firehouse in shambles. She attempts to
				explain what happened to the team when a NY News 6 report reveals tremors
				at Central Park.</p>
